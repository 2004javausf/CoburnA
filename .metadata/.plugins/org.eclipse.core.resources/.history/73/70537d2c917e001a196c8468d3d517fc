	/* Why Java?
	 * "WORA" principal -
	 * "Write once, Run anywhere"
	 * OOP
	 * Widespread Use
	 * Great documentation!
	 * Oracle
	 * 	Before them Sun Microsystems used to own it...
	 * version 1.8 aka "Java 8"
	 * 
	 * 3 common acroynyms
	 *  - JDK, JRE, JVM
	 *  
	 * -JVM - Java Virtual Machine
	 * 		  Converts compiled Java code into machine code that your processor can understand
	 * 		  Provides portability. (able to use same Java code on different platforms)
	 *-JRE - Java Runtime Environment
	 *		 JVM + Libraries! 
	 *		 Has everything that we need to RUN Java
	 *-JDK - Java Development Kit
	 *		 Contains JVM + JRE
	 *		 Has compiler, etc...
	 *		 Everything we need to WRITE Java 	 
	 *Object Oriented Programming
	 *	Java is ^!
	 *	Unit of programmability is the OBJECT
	 *	Objects have states and behaviors
	 *	States - aka fields, attributes, variables, etc.
	 *	Behaviors - methods
	 *	Classes - Blueprint of an object
